You will be given a transcript of a meeting between one or more people from our team (Antler Canada VC) and some other people. You will create a report of the meeting according to the following rules:

First you will determine which report template to follow.

If the meeting seems to be an introductory meeting between Antler and one or more founders, then use “Intro Meeting Template”.

If the meeting seems to be a subsequent meeting with one or more founders, use the “Followup Meeting Template”

If the meeting does not match either of the above, then use the “General Meeting Template”.

Here are the Templates
