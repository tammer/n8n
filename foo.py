      "content": "Unknown speaker: Thank Good. Hello.\nElie Kasongo: Hello. I'm\nTammer Kamel: very good, thanks. How are you?\nElie Kasongo: I'm very, very good. Let me just check in with Rida. Just give me one second. Okay, just while in the meantime, where are you calling from?\nTammer Kamel: I'm in Toronto. Okay,\nElie Kasongo: Toronto. I'm usually in and out of Toronto. Live part-time there. I stay in London, London, Ontario. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I'm two hours. Is it two hours? Yeah. An hour and a half away. Yeah, thank you.\nTammer Kamel: Hour and a half away. Are you from Toronto or London or somewhere?\nElie Kasongo: I grew up in Mississauga.\nTammer Kamel: Oh, okay. So you're, yeah. So that's essentially Toronto.\nElie Kasongo: Basically, basically. Yeah. Okay. Just see. I'll be running late to another meeting. Yeah, no problem. So just give me a few minutes. I'll give them a call.\nTammer Kamel: Okay. Sure. Thank you.\nElie Kasongo: Okay, so he says he'd be in shortly, just running, just running late in the meeting.\nTammer Kamel: Okay, no problem. Maybe I can just, I'll hold off properly introducing myself until he gets here, but I can use the time to ask a couple basic questions. So you're in, you're basically right here in GTA or line of day. Yep. Your partner, whose name is? Rita. Rita? Is that how you say it? Yep. Where is he based? He's\nElie Kasongo: based out of Montreal. So he's half and half Toronto and Montreal.\nTammer Kamel: Oh, and why does he do half and half?\nElie Kasongo: He works full time right now. So he's currently funding us. So who's shopping. So he works as a senior engineer at Woffsimple.\nTammer Kamel: Okay, and so he has to be in the office for half the years, half the time. No,\nElie Kasongo: it's primarily remote, but they do come into the office and work from there.\nTammer Kamel: So he lives in Montreal? Yes,\nElie Kasongo: lives in Montreal.\nTammer Kamel: So he comes to Toronto when Wealth Simple needs him in Toronto. He\nElie Kasongo: just comes to Toronto on his own. When we do co-work and his girlfriend lives in Montreal as well, so in Toronto. So he's always in Toronto.\nTammer Kamel: So what's the point of being in Montreal? Why doesn't he just live in Toronto? It's a\nElie Kasongo: good question, you know, I did ask him, but he did say it's a, it's pricier in Toronto,\nTammer Kamel: so. That's true. It is that, I guess. Got it. And how did you guys meet?\nElie Kasongo: We met on YC, YC's co-founding platform that they had. And yeah, we just sort of, he introduced himself to me, really liked the idea that I had pitched and our stories were very similar. And yeah, we've been working ever since together.\nTammer Kamel: So this was your idea originally, and told the story to Rito, and then he liked it. Yeah.\nElie Kasongo: And the idea just came, you know, I have a policy background, you know, private interest lobbying background. So that's mostly, hey, Rita. That's mostly what I've done. So that's sort of where the idea came from and sprouted from was sort of the regulatory and compliance policy space.\nTammer Kamel: Got it. Hi, Rita.\nRida F'kih: Hey, how you doing? Sorry, I'm late.\nTammer Kamel: And no problem. Where are you in Montreal?\nRida F'kih: I am in Montreal, yeah.\nTammer Kamel: I was just asking Eli about where you guys each live. He said you kind of go back and forth, Toronto, Montreal. You have an employer in Toronto and a girlfriend in Toronto. So I said to him, well, why doesn't he just move to Toronto?\nRida F'kih: But he didn't\nTammer Kamel: have an answer for that.\nRida F'kih: You know what? I'm thinking about it, for real. Yeah. Yeah. Are\nTammer Kamel: you from Montreal?\nRida F'kih: No, I'm from Calgary originally.\nTammer Kamel: Oh, okay. Yeah. How did you end up in Montreal?\nRida F'kih: I like traveling a lot and I wanted to be closer to Europe. So I came to Montreal. I wanted to\nTammer Kamel: be closer to Europe. So\nRida F'kih: you went a\nTammer Kamel: thousand kilometers\nRida F'kih: closer. Well, I came to Montreal, but then I like traveling to Japan more now. So now I'm further from Japan. I\nTammer Kamel: think, well, I mean, you're pretty far from Japan anywhere you are in Canada because they all, they go over the North Pole these days or they used to. Maybe they start using\nRida F'kih: that. You know, from Calgary, you're flying over the Pacific and it's like eight hours from here. It's like 15 because you're going around Russia. Right. So, yeah.\nTammer Kamel: Got it. Okay, well, nice to meet you. I'm Tammer. I'm a general partner at Antler. I'll just briefly introduce me. I joined Antler just this year. Prior to that, I myself was an entrepreneur. I founded a company in 2012. It was called Quantal. It was sort of venture funded out of Silicon Valley. We did our series A and series B in Silicon Valley. And that's as far as we got before we got acquired in 2019 by NASDAQ, the stock exchange. So the whole thing was a good outcome for myself, my partner, my investors, employees, kind of everyone, which was great and everything, but then I didn't have a company to run anymore. So I worked for Nasdaq for a few years and then I didn't, you know, that isn't the most thrilling job I've ever had. So I stepped out of that and found my way to Antler. And the idea here is that Antler is an inception stage VC. I know a thing or two about startups having run one for almost a decade. And so the idea is basically, A, I probably have some advantages identifying individuals who have the capability and the tools and the resilience to succeed as founders. And probably more importantly, once we've made an investment, I can occasionally be impactful with some words of wisdom, having seen a lot of things in my own journey. So I like to say, I, you know, I know a thing or two about startups, not because I read a book about it, but because I did it and made every mistake you can make and then learn from those and now I'm smarter for it. So anyway, so that's me. I know a whole lot about you guys because I watched most of the note-taker AI video thing that Alex had. So we don't have to retrace past steps. I will almost certainly ask you nothing you've been asked before, but probably we'll just build on the previous conversation. But let me pause there see if there's anything you want to ask before I start asking you other questions.\nRida F'kih: On my side, I think I'm good.\nTammer Kamel: Okay, let's dive in. I mean, everything I heard was intriguing. I think, as of this instant, from our perspective, this is an intriguing opportunity that we could be tempted to doing what we call a virtual residency where we work very closely with you for some weeks to build up our conviction on you and this opportunity. And then that culminates in us investing our $250,000. So that's the kind of, this call for me is about exploring whether that makes sense for you guys and for us. So the product. It is, you're going to put a layer somewhere between the intranet or the company's internal servers or something and the outside world. Anything being any packages heading for chat GPT are going to be intercepted, analyzed in some way and sanitized if necessary, then sent on to chat GPT with certain possibly compromising information removed. The value proposition being of course, it allows organizations to be confident that, well, I mean, actually they can just plug and play in now any cloud-based AI and be confident that nothing that they don't want getting out gets out. How is that for pitching your business back to you?\nRida F'kih: That was great, one of the best. I feel like a lot of people when we go into these meetings don't really understand what's going on, so that was cool. Yeah,\nTammer Kamel: that's a good start. And I also thought to myself, this thing is highest aspiration. You could actually have your own little bit of AI sitting on your thing that could do some smart stuff. You don't have to be perfectly deterministic. You could actually have AI analyze the prompt. If you wanted to, I guess.\nRida F'kih: We do, actually. So one of the, so we have two avenues where we have the deterministic slash algorithmic is what I've been calling it sort of like rules. And then we also have like a AI-based one where you can have an AI return, like a true or false or have it like, We annotate and then we can also scan the annotation. So one example I did, I don't know if it's in the demo that Eli sent, but if you send an angry message or was the example I was using. Of course, that's not a very useful example, but it is like an example that just shows that it's possible. I can have it block those specifically.\nTammer Kamel: Very cool. This is for me one of these solutions that one would suspect there should be demand for, but the only true arbiter of demand is the market itself. And I heard on the call you had some hospital here in Ontario that might be a good first prospect. Tell me more about that.\nElie Kasongo: Yeah. One of the things that I have solely come to learn, especially just from reading and conversations. And actually, the same CEO of the hospital mentioned this as well. A lot of, I guess, CSOs or a lot of these regulated industries are learning about AI governance. They're sort of, it's something that's now that wasn't stressing them in the past, but it is stressing them more now. And they're quickly learning it. So the hospitals are now starting to get on top of it. I've started to see hospital CSOs. One of them I'm trying to set up a conversation with just here in my hometown, London Healthcare Center. Their CISO was letting me know that that's a conversation that they're now having is AI governance, but it wasn't a conversation that they were having before. So there's a lot of teaching that we're sort of also doing in these conversations. There's a lot of learning and also making sure that we are talking about the issue of great conviction. So that's another part of it. Now the hospital CEO was a great first conversation for us. It really informed a lot of what we did and I think Rida can speak on that in regards to the tech. But that conversation really helped us to see that A, there is a really big need, depending on how we approach the situation.\nTammer Kamel: But why do you think, did the hospital CEO say, because you said you had to do some teaching, which usually tells me they don't even realize they need your software.\nElie Kasongo: We didn't have to do teaching with him. So it is something he was a very good first conversation for us.\nTammer Kamel: So when you say first conversation, like,\nElie Kasongo: what\nTammer Kamel: is that? I mean, can you sell him something? Is he going to be a customer?\nElie Kasongo: First conversation in the sense of he was our first real feedback that we received on\nTammer Kamel: Sedna. Okay, so let me step back. What is your, yeah, maybe I'm being presumptuous here. Are you trying to go to market at this juncture? Are you still building or what are you trying to do right now? I\nRida F'kih: think in the past like past two weeks we've started to really want to go to market. The product was really early on before. So it was really difficult to approach a customer like the hospital and be like, hey, we're ready for you to deploy this at your company. Now at this point is the point where we're\nTammer Kamel: like, okay. You have a software that will work in production if you have a customer?\nRida F'kih: We do, yeah, yeah. Okay, so how\nTammer Kamel: much, do you have any sense of what you can get someone to pay for this?\nRida F'kih: So right now, We didn't do any like big market research. And I think that's something that Eli and I have to figure out. So we've kind of just decided on like $8 to $12, depending on the plan per head. And for the companies that we've been talking to, that doesn't seem to be a problem. So we've got few startups signed to try Sedna.\nTammer Kamel: Two startups.\nRida F'kih: Yeah. Why do the\nTammer Kamel: startup want setna?\nRida F'kih: Ellie, how did we get the startups?\nElie Kasongo: Yeah, so for the startups and approaching the small teams, so actually some of them, we're part of two communities, we're part of the Rogers Cybersecure network, and then we're part of LOI, League of Innovators. So with the Rogers Cybersecure, a lot of the companies there will be looking for auditing and also looking to secure their own security posture, right, in terms of their own stack. So there's some interest there for Sedna to be part of their security stack in that way. Okay.\nTammer Kamel: Okay. So it sounds like basically you're at the very early stages of going to market. Is that a fair characterization?\nElie Kasongo: Yep, very\nTammer Kamel: early. What is, so what, do you have any, I mean, what's the goal here? You want to get some customers in the near future, I guess is the goal? Definitely.\nRida F'kih: I think at the beginning we started going for really big, customers from the get-go. So the hospital was one of them. And I think we will be re-approaching, Ellie and I have talked about it. Re-approaching the hospital very soon here. But I think we've kind of decided to step away from like really big clients to start. just so that we can approve other big clients or maybe even investors and be like, hey, we have people using the software. Like that's been a big point of contention for everybody. So we were talking to the VP of Scotia Bank, for example. And he\nTammer Kamel: was saying that in the other, yeah, and they said it should be interesting, but long sale second, I get\nRida F'kih: all that. But your\nTammer Kamel: customer, the bigger, the smaller your customer, in general, the less they will want or need this thing. Do you agree?\nRida F'kih: Yes, yeah, I do. I think that the, like we've been kind of at this junction of like social proof blocking further sales. So it's like, I think now we're trying to approach smaller customers so that we can get some testimonials, get some\nTammer Kamel: social proof. Who's an example of a small customer that would need your service?\nElie Kasongo: So there's clinics, law firms, those are some of\nTammer Kamel: the ones. Okay, so law firms, law firms is a good one. Have you spoken to any of those?\nElie Kasongo: Yeah, we've been reaching out to one, one of them here in London, Bellocke and Bellocke. That's,\nTammer Kamel: you know,\nElie Kasongo: coincidentally, they sold me my house. that's it. Yeah, they're in London, they're London based. The conversation went well, but again, we're very early on. There wasn't, the product wasn't where it is now. So we do plan on reaching back to them. Okay. Okay.\nTammer Kamel: Let me just see what else I got on my list\nElie Kasongo: here.\nTammer Kamel: Where are you incorporated?\nElie Kasongo: We're incorporated Ontario, London.\nTammer Kamel: Okay, perfect. So Rita, you're working full time and that in channeling that those funds into the business to, I guess, so Eli can work\nRida F'kih: on the\nTammer Kamel: business and you, and then you're, but you're also writing the software when you're not writing code for wealth simple. Is that the idea?\nRida F'kih: That is, yes. Okay, got\nTammer Kamel: So then if we invested $250,000, would you then be able to quit your job? Yeah. How much would you pay yourself? I'm\nRida F'kih: thinking like my ideas in the realm of like Canadian 80 to 100, you know, enough to like pay my rent and, you know, buy food and maybe have a hobby or two, but not nearly as much as I'm making right now. And then maybe once we get further funding, I can, you know, bump up a little Okay.\nTammer Kamel: And Eli, how much do you need to pay yourself? Same?\nElie Kasongo: No, I don't think I need to be paid the same. We really wanna prioritize bolstering engineering. So I do know one of the plans we have is to bring on an engineer. I don't know how that will be structured. So for me, I have some savings, so 50K would probably be just fine.\nTammer Kamel: Yeah, okay, yeah.\nRida F'kih: Does that sound reasonable? Because I've thrown that number out, which is the number. It's a\nTammer Kamel: little high. I mean, I don't know your life situation. So I'm not wanting to, I mean, usually the founders we invest in are, live very sparsely for the first six or nine months on like 50, for example, would be more or less. But I always say this, what I don't want is to be funding someone's country club membership. But, you Right. So it's really a function. If you're in a stage in life where you have a mortgage to pay, okay, then that's something, right. I mean, it's not like I'm going to peer into your personal finances anyway. But so the point being, there's no hard number. We're just looking for people to forego their yacht club\nRida F'kih: membership. It's not a hard number, so I would be willing to come down,\nTammer Kamel: course. Okay, yeah, it's not, no, I mean, I'm not, nor am I negotiating. I'm just trying to get a sense of how far, how long 250K lasts\nRida F'kih: is really the\nTammer Kamel: motivation of my question.\nRida F'kih: Got it.\nTammer Kamel: Okay, so as I look at your business right now, I think you guys are way ahead on product and behind on validation. So in other words, you need to get hard evidence that the world wants what you're building.\nRida F'kih: That\nTammer Kamel: somebody is willing to pay for One of the things we advocate for for companies at your stage and even before this stage is going out and finding customers are talking to them and telling them what you're doing. And if the product's not ready, we tell people to get what we call letters of intent. Get somebody to sign a thing saying, God damn it, I need this thing. And as soon as it's ready, I'll pay much. It's really, really, important. One of the risks of what you're doing right now is that you're ahead of your time, that companies are not scared enough yet about what you're protecting them from. And if, and this is why I was preserved when Eli mentioned teaching, as soon as your sales process involves teaching the customer why they need you, my God, does that sales process get harder. You need the customer to be experiencing the pain and not you telling them, oh, you have this pain that you don't even know you have. That's a hard sell. Yeah. Right? So, you know, as I look at this business from our perspective, this looks interesting. This looks like a type of thing we could, you know, get invested in at some point. But what I would want to really see in the coming, I mean, there's only a couple of weeks left this year before the world turns itself off, but in, you in the coming weeks in the early January is for you to to really ramp up your go-to-market motions and start, you know, one conversation, like lawyers is a great idea, but you should have 50 conversations going with lawyers, not one, right? And so, So to the extent that you're interested in advancing the relationship with us towards an investment at some point in Q1. What I'd like to do is start having regular dialogues with you. And to be very honest, measure what you achieve between those dialogues. How do you feel about that?\nElie Kasongo: That's awesome.\nRida F'kih: Yeah.\nElie Kasongo: sense. Makes sense,\nTammer Kamel: Okay. I think we should do that. If I may, you know, presume to give you some advice, get selling. Get calling, cold calling, cold emailing, whatever you have to do, because there's a chance there's no demand for this thing. And if there's no demand for it, for God's sake, let's find out now so we can do, we can react to that. The worst thing you could do now build for another three months only to discover in April that you're ahead of your time. Right. Find out now. So this is, and this is the thing with startups too, right. This is the shittiest part of the whole job is what you have to do right now. It's, you know, conceiving the product, building the product. That's awesome. That's fun. Right. This is not fun, but too bad. It has to be done.\nElie Kasongo: Yeah. That makes sense.\nTammer Kamel: Awesome. So I'm gonna kind of say, okay, I'm gonna put you down like to your advantage. I'm gonna say as of right now, you basically have zero prospects in your pipeline. That way whatever's in there in January when we talk again counts as positive traction. You know what\nElie Kasongo: I mean?\nRida F'kih: There's a good number, I like that. That's good.\nTammer Kamel: But seriously, I mean, I know you gotta get hamstrung by the holidays a bit, but you've got 10 days now, maybe 12 before, You know, it's hopeless. But I would set yourself a target, Eli, of getting 100 conversations. Like, seriously, 100 conversations before the world shuts down. And by the way, let me give you a couple other pro tips on this. You don't have to go in through these calls as a salesperson. You can play the aspirational entrepreneur card. So in other words, hey, my name is Eli. I'm a young ambitious founder. I'd like to get your advice on something we're working on. People love to give advice, right? People love to help young founders. You can play it case by case, but people don't want to be sold to, much harder to sell to. So to get some of these initial conversations going, You can play the young founder just looking for a break, looking for some help card. And then you say, hey, look, ask them a bit about what they're doing. But anyway, you start hinting, showing them what your idea is and see if, the one trap there is, this is another important point. You got your call recorder on here, so this is good. Another important point is don't lead them to the answer you want to hear. Okay, because everybody's going to want to make you happy. Do you like my software? Oh, I love your software. You guys are\nRida F'kih: awesome. Right?\nTammer Kamel: So people want to be nice to you. So you somehow have, when you have these conversations, especially at the beginning before you're talking about your software, you have to ask stuff like, you know, how much AI are you using? How much, you know, what AI tools are you using? You've got to make it so that. they don't know what you're really fishing for. Ask the whole, you can ask some random questions that have nothing to do with what you care about just to get them off the\nRida F'kih: scent. Because what you\nTammer Kamel: want to do is get confirmation that they're actually a little bit worried or they haven't adopted chat GPT because of security issues. That's a really cool thing, right? Or they're worried about privacy. How are you worried about privacy with chat GPT? Yes, no, right? This sort of thing. So you don't want them to quite know what answer you're hoping for. So then it has credibility for you. You know what I mean? Don't leave them. But all this on a mission to get... evidence that they care about what you think they should be caring about, and then moving down towards, is it, would they pay money to make this problem go away? And if you get yes to those two questions, you can say, it's what I'm working on, can I tell you a bit about that, and off you go, yeah. And, but again, for the first few conversations, don't even, like, don't sell, right? Don't sell, just build relationships. And maybe you get a design partner out of this or a beta user or a pilot customer. That's what you're looking for out of the gate here, okay?\nRida F'kih: Cool. I think you saw a smirk a little bit because I was saying something very similar to Eli last night. Okay,\nElie Kasongo: cool. Yeah, same conversation.\nRida F'kih: So awesome. Yeah, we'll act on that and we'll keep you in the loop on how that goes.\nTammer Kamel: Let's calendar. Sure. I follow up meeting for, I'm going to just, I'm going to literally clone this invite. And I'm going to set it for January. Call 16th at this exact same time. Does that work for you guys? Yeah. Yep. Okay. I'm pressing save. Are you both on the invite? Yes. Okay, press send the invite. So I'm going to be very interested in the Delta. I'm going to be very interested in what was accomplished between this date and when we talk again in January.\nElie Kasongo: Awesome. Okay.\nRida F'kih: We look forward to it.\nTammer Kamel: All right. Go get them, guys. Nice meeting you, and I'm excited about what you're\nRida F'kih: doing. Thanks, Mike.\nElie Kasongo: Talk soon.\nTammer Kamel: We'll see you. Bye.\nUnknown speaker: but thankfully caught you at the at the head of it so\nTammer Kamel: yeah it's everyone seems to be getting sick these days it's I don't know I guess it's the season for it\nRida F'kih: yeah Ellie just just finished being sick for the past like week so\nTammer Kamel: Okay, well I hope I hope it's short, a short- lived suffering. Oh,\nRida F'kih: me too. Me too. Thank you.\nTammer Kamel: Is, is Eli joining us?\nRida F'kih: He should be, I just texted him. He texted me a few minutes ago, so I assume he's out and about.\nTammer Kamel: Okay. Yeah, so we\nRida F'kih: can just, we just wait for\nTammer Kamel: him.\nRida F'kih: Yeah. Yeah. Let me shoot him a little FaceTime call real quick.\nTammer Kamel: Okay. Okay. We're\nRida F'kih: no response. Okay, well, if he doesn't join the next two minutes, then we could either continue. He has a lot of context around how the calls went and all the outreach. So maybe we want to reschedule. I'm not sure.\nTammer Kamel: Sure. Why don't we reschedule then? Do you have the link or do I mean, I'm... I mean, I'm a little bit disappointed to be honest. I mean, like, you guys are going to create a billion- dollar company. You got to be able to show up for calls\nRida F'kih: on time. 100%. I'm 100% with you. Yeah. Yeah, I'll go ahead and reschedule the thing. I'm really sorry for this. I'm going to see what happened with Ellie. That sucks. I'm so disappointed.\nTammer Kamel: Hold on, is he here?"
